# Introduction to Data Science

The zip file contains the 3 module assignments:

- Addition to the library of missing datasets,
- regression modelling,
- clustering. 

The addition to the library of missing datasets talks about a need for an internationally linked missing persons dataset and talks about the process used in the UK. 

The regression modelling file uses a dataset about bird strike incidents from variety of aircraft and operators which I found insightful being within the RAF myself.

The clustering file uses a dataset describing percentage of energy source usage from a reasonable number of energy sources. It was interesting to see which ones have similar usage (further through the file where graphs are given) as some you wouldn't expect to be similar/ or are sources that are not talked about much in wider society.
